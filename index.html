	<p align="justify"> I am a physicist broadly interested in the ideas at the intersection between condensed matter theory, quantum computing, and machine learning. A significant fraction of my research is naturally devoted the development and use of large-scale numerical simulations, with an emphasis on Quantum Monte Carlo, Machine Learning, and (a little bit of) Tensor Networks, aimed at tackling challenging theoretical and technological problems in quantum many-body physics and quantum computing.</p> <br />


        <h2>Some highlights of my research</h2> <br />
        	<ul>
        		<li> We revitalized the connection between the areas of computer vision and the theory of strongly correlated many-body systems. We showed that neural networks have the ability to learn representations of ordered and topologically ordered states of matter. Published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v13/n5/full/nphys4035.html">Nature Physics</a> </li> <br />
  			<li> We used Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) to perform quantum state tomography in systems of unprecedented size.  Arxiv  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05334">link</a></li> <br />
  			<li> We developed Monte Carlo simulations that led to a novel approach to search for potential topological quantum spin-liquids on a broad class of materials. Published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8421">Nature communications</a> . </li> <br />
