	<p> I am a physicist broadly interested in the ideas at the intersection between condensed matter theory, quantum computing, and machine learning. A significant fraction of my research is naturally devoted the development and use of large-scale numerical simulations, with an emphasis on Quantum Monte Carlo, Machine Learning, and some Tensor Networks, aimed at tackling challenging theoretical and technological problems in quantum many-body physics and quantum computing. <a href="/about">Read more about </a></p>
