	<h1>Juan Felipe Carrasquilla Alvarez</h1>
	<p> I am a physicist broadly interested in the ideas at the intersection between condensed matter theory, quantum computing, and machine learning. A significant fraction of my research is naturally devoted the development and use of large-scale numerical simulations, with an emphasis on Quantum Monte Carlo, Machine Learning, and (a little bit of) Tensor Networks, aimed at tackling challenging theoretical and technological problems in quantum many-body physics and quantum computing.</p> <br />

        <h2>Some highlights of my research</h2> <br />
