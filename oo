  <li> We revitalized the connection between the areas of computer vision and the theory of strongly correlated many-body systems. We showed that neural networks have the ability to learn representations of ordered and topologically ordered states of matter.

  <li> We used Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) to perform quantum state tomography in systems of unprecedented size.  Arxiv  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05334">link</a></li>
  <li> We developed Monte Carlo simulations that led to a novel approach to search for potential topological quantum spin-liquids on a broad class of materials. Published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8421">Nature communications</a> . </li>
